so each row will contain a column
 
                DROP TABLE IF EXISTS  interrogation_PLOTLY;
                CREATE TABLE interrogation_PLOTLY (
                    company_NAME                varchar(5000),
                    phone_NUMBER                varchar (500),
                    email                       varchar (200),
                    date_OF_VISIT               timestamp,
                    applied                     varchar(100) -- really should be a yes or no

                );
                
                
its best for us to look at one item each in the list, this way we can focus on one item at a time and decide whats best to look for in each item in the list and we can make a better table as a result


so for each element we have its parents, its siblings, its children and the element itself, however I want to see details so lets add the factmodules in each as well


in intergattion in the circumstances the API sees something we do not like, it can modify the pointValue, partialMatch was a way to interrogate, so we can use more mthods


so when we make our table were looking at one value in list at a time
